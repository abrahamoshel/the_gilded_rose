# The Gilded Rose Code Kata

This kata is inspired by a talk from RailsConf 2014 in Chicago by Sandi Metz.

Repo was originally pulled from https://github.com/jimweirich/gilded_rose_kata and edited a bit. Also I have included Sandi's Tests as well from https://gist.github.com/skmetz/7772668

The goal is to clean up the code and remove as much complexity as possible.

###Helpful Hints:

- Let the tests guide you in your refactoring of the code
- Refactor before you add new functionality (just a suggestion)
- To run the rspec test you can just run `rspec`
- To run the minitest `ruby gilded_rose_test.rb`
- I prefer to run both of them at the same time with `rspec && ruby gilded_rose_test.rb`

### To Participate:

1. Fork the repo and create a new folder in submission with your name/handle.
2. After you have refactored solution create a pull request to have it merge back in.
3. Lastly Participate by looking at others code and give feedback and support. I will leave pull request open for a week or two so that we can all have a change to look at peoples submissions.
